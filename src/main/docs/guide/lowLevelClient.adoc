We will query the iTunes repository for the artist and expect to receive several pieces of information in the form of JSON, such
as album name and a URL link to the album. In order to capture the return data easily, we can create POJOs with properties
named exactly the same as the JSON structure.  The iTunes API will return `resultCount` with a list of albums that contain:

- `artistName`
- `collectionName`
- `collectionViewUrl`

Create the following POJOs:

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/example/grails/SearchResult.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/groovy/example/grails/SearchResult.groovy[]
----

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/example/grails/Album.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/groovy/example/grails/Album.groovy[]
----

We need to configure Micronaut to accept the `text/javascript` MIME type from the iTunes API.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.yml[tag=mime]
----

In the `ItunesSearchService`, we create the low level client and use the API to contact `iTunes.apple.com`.  Conceptually we are
going to create a client with a `baseUrl`, then form a request object that sends a `GET` request with URL params.
Subsequently, we will issue a blocking request and received a String response. `ObjectMapper` from Jackson Databind will
map the incoming JSON to the POJOs. Add the following to `ItunesSearchService`:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/services/example/grails/ItunesSearchService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/example/grails/ItunesSearchService.groovy[tag=searchWithApi]
----

<1> Issue the request with a blocking call, and accept a String response.
<2> Ignore extra properties.
<3> Map the JSON into the POJOs.

'''

Run `./gradlew bootRun` and hit `http://localhost:8080/search/searchWithApi?searchTerm=U2` and see the results.
