The `/initial` folder is a grails app created with the `rest-api` profile. It is a simple app setup to query the
https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api[Apple Itunes API].
The app takes in a `searchTerm` and is layered with:

- `example.grails.SearchController`
- `example.grails.ItunesSearchService`

The call is stubbed out until we implement it.

Verify the functionality by running `./gradlew bootRun` and then going to the URL `http://localhost:8080/search/searchWithApi?searchTerm=U2`.

You should see dummy data JSON returned.
