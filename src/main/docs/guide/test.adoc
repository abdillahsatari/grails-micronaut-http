The Micronaut Client can also be used for testing purposes with Spock. In our music app let's create a domain object to capture
record labels. We will use the grails built-in https://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/REST.html#domainResources[REST API for domain classes].

Create a domain object and tag it with `@Resource` and a given URI. This will expose REST functionality for the object.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/domain/example/grails/RecordLabel.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/example/grails/RecordLabel.groovy[]
----

In the `BootStrap.groovy`, add some seed data for testing purposes:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/init/example/grails/BootStrap.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/init/example/grails/BootStrap.groovy[]
----

Let's create an integration test suite that first does a `GET` request to retrieve the existing list of RecordLabels. The test will
also issue a `POST` to insert one more record label, with a map of data passed in. In both tests, we will verify that the response comes back correctly.

[source, groovy]
.src/integration-test/groovy/example/grails/RecordLabelControllerSpec.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/integration-test/groovy/example/grails/RecordLabelControllerSpec.groovy[]
----

<1> Initialize the client once for all tests. Give it a URL with `serverPort` which is the assigned port of the integration test.
<2> Issue a `GET`. The expected body type will be a List of Maps.
<3> Verify the status and body elements of the JSON.
<4> Send a map of data to the `POST`, which will be interpreted as JSON.
<5> Verify the status and returned data for the test.

Test the app with `./gradlew check`.
