The Micronaut HTTP Client dependency is included in the grails `rest-api` profile and replaces the `datastore-rest-client`.
As of Grails 4, it is the recommended HTTP Client for Grails. (The old HTTP client is still backward compatible in Grails 4).

In our music app we will be using the Micronaut HTTP client in both service functionality and testing so we must change
the qualifier in `build.gradle` to `compile`:

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
    ...
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=micronautDependency]
}
